# Azrea Personal Daily Companion Version 1.0.0

Daily Companion is a personal assistant app I created for myself to stay organized, motivated, and informed throughout the day. It’s designed to simplify daily routines by combining reminders, weather alerts, note-taking, and productivity tools into one sleek, customizable app.

Built with my lifestyle in mind, Daily Companion helps me track tasks, moods, and important events — all wrapped in a modern Material Design interface.

This app is my daily companion, helping me manage everything from appointments to motivational boosts, and I’m excited to develop it further to help others do the same.
